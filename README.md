# notetaker-hs

Simple and sample notetaker application used to take notes written in Haskell.

This small project was made while learing Haskell.

Uses [Spock](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock) and its built-in support for server state. Server state is used to implement an in-memory database of notes.
